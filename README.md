This project uses Sharp Proximity sensor, Pressure sensor, Emax Servo Motor and Neopixel LED strip. When the object detected by the proximity sensor is in close range, the 3D printed door on the servo rotates to open. When the door is open and pressure is applied on the FSR, it closes the door. 
The 3D printed door and the building is supposed to be a garage. The base where the electronics reside has been laser cut. You can find the file dimensions and the laser cutting plan in laser.ai file. All of the stl files and gcode also has been uploaded to this repo.
